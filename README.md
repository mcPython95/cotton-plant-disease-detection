## Introduction

This project focuses on detecting diseases in cotton plants using machine learning techniques. Early detection of diseases in cotton plants can help farmers take preventive measures and ensure better crop yields. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on ResNet152 architecture for image classification.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (or keras)
- OpenCV
- torch
- torchvision
- PIL
- jax

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow opencv-python torch torchvision pillow jax
```

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mcPython95/cotton-plant-disease-detection.git
   cd cotton-plant-disease-detection
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of cotton plants with different diseases. It includes labels for various diseases such as leaf blight, bacterial blight, and healthy plants.

## Model Architecture and Optimization

### ResNet152 Architecture

- **ResNet152**: This architecture is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with 152 layers. It is known for its performance in image classification tasks due to its ability to handle the vanishing gradient problem through the use of residual blocks.
- **Modifications**: The final fully connected layer was modified to adapt to the specific number of classes in this project, followed by ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.

### Optimization Techniques

- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss was used as the loss function to measure the performance of the classification model.
- **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9 was employed to update the weights of the network.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: ReduceLROnPlateau was used to adjust the learning rate when the validation loss plateaued, ensuring efficient training.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The model is built using a ResNet152 architecture. The training and evaluation process includes data loading and preprocessing, image augmentation, building and compiling the CNN model, training the model, evaluating the model's performance, and visualizing the results.

## Results

The model performed exceptionally well in detecting diseases in cotton plants. It achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 97%. Precision and recall were both high, indicating that the model is effective at identifying both diseased and healthy plants accurately. The F1-Score, which balances precision and recall, was also high. The model demonstrated a low error rate and high specificity, meaning it correctly identified the majority of healthy plants without falsely marking them as diseased. The ROC-AUC score was also high, indicating excellent performance in distinguishing between different classes of plant health.

### Classification Report Summary

- **Diseased Cotton Leaf**: The model perfectly identified diseased cotton leaves with high precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Diseased Cotton Plant**: The model showed high precision and recall for detecting diseased cotton plants, ensuring minimal misclassification.
- **Fresh Cotton Leaf**: Fresh cotton leaves were accurately identified, maintaining a high F1-score.
- **Fresh Cotton Plant**: The model also accurately detected fresh cotton plants, with high precision and recall.

### Overall Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 96.84%
- **Precision**: 97.10%
- **Recall**: 96.74%
- **F1-Score**: 96.92%
- **Specificity**: 97.10%
- **ROC-AUC**: 97.83%
- **Error Rate**: 3.16%
